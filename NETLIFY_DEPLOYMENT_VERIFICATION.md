## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you still see "Page not found":**

3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors

### **If styles are broken:**

1. Verify build completed without errors
2. Check browser developer tools for CSS load errors
3. Try clearing browser cache
